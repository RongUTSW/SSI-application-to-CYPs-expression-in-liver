# SSI-application-to-CYPs-expression-in-liver

CYP3A4 is the predominant drug metabolizing enzyme in the liver, displaying large inter-person variability of unknown causes. 
CYP3A4 transcription is controlled by hepatic transcription factors (TFs), but how TFs dynamically interact remains uncertain.  
We hypothesize that several TFs form a regulatory network with nonlinear, dynamic, and hierarchical interactions.  

In this study, we applied a computational approach for estimating Sobolâ€™s Sensitivity Indices (SSI) under generalized linear models, to existing liver RNA expression microarray data (GSE9588) and RNAseq data from GTEx, generating robust importance ranking of TF effects and interactions.
