# SSI-application-to-CYPs-expression-in-liver

CYP3A4 is the predominant drug metabolizing enzyme in the liver, displaying large inter-person variability of unknown causes. 
CYP3A4 transcription is controlled by hepatic transcription factors (TFs), but how TFs dynamically interact remains uncertain.  
We hypothesize that several TFs form a regulatory network with nonlinear, dynamic, and hierarchical interactions.  

In this study, we applied Sobolâ€™s Sensitivity Indices (SSI) to existing liver RNA expression microarray data (GSE9588) and RNAseq data from GTEx, generating robust importance ranking of TF effects and interactions. 

The key functions used for the analysis were summarized in R script "combined_summary_script_06022019.R"
